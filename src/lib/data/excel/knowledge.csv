The release of her new\nbook, \""A New Clue\"", comes only \nfourteen months after the distressful\nreport of the author's mysterious\nand unexplained disappearance.\r\n     Her current publisher has issued a statement debunking the conspiracy theories surrounding the book's recent announcement stating \""The writing of the book was completed and well into the editing stages many months before [the disappearance].\""  In addition, the publisher has revealed that all of the proceeds from first edition sales of \""A New Clue\"" will be going to LASTING HOPE, a non-profit organization that aims to provide resources and intel in the investigations of missing persons. Still, the timing and  conveniently mysterious title of Marigold's third book has left many cynics denouncing the book and her disappearance as a cheap publicity stunt. Detective Bon Margle, who\nmany theorize may have been the inspiration for \""A New Clue\"", was quoted only saying that the book was \""unintentionally accurate.\""\n     Regardless of their opinions, fans, pundits and cynics alike were standing together, elbow to elbow in bookshop queues this morning eager to get their hands on what may\n   very likely be the last words ever published by the missing author. thaw only in the event of my death\n\nSimon,\nI had wished for you to read this letter upon first arriving at Mt. Holly but I couldn't risk the contents of these pages falling into unsympathetic hands.\n\nMy personal freezer should prove quite the safebox, as all of the staff have for many years respected my wishes that it remain shut and untampered. (My favorite snacks were also stored here!)\n \nBut in addition to these delicious treats, it has also for the last 20 years stored many a cryptic message and ciphered note. This nondescript cooler is, in fact, a dubious frozen postbox of chilled secrets.\n\nHave you heard of the Children of Black Water?\n\nI have no idea how forthcoming your father has been about the details surrounding your mother's final chapter... or the role he thinks I played in that end. I have always denied involvement. To him. To the detectives. To the crown. And now to you as well.\n\nBut can I honestly say I had nothing to do with her disappearance? And yes, I speak of disappearance, not death. For I, too, cling to the hope that our fears are unfounded, and have occasionally, from time to time, caught fragments of information that bolster this belief.\n\nFragments of information that have cost me plenty, for our country is never short of opportunists and blackmailers.\n\nStill, as I am now dead, I don't want this knowledge to be buried with me, even if that means passing the burden of these fragments onto you. Even if that information may weigh even heavier on your head than the crown involved.\n\nUnfortunately, this information is a little too precious to entrust entirely to this freezer as I'm not too confident that the sanctity of my snacks will extend beyond my life! I've always found it best to use multiple baskets when it comes to incriminating eggs; a lesson that I recently learned again when a member of my staff betrayed my confidence.\n \nI have placed eight red envelopes in eight even more secure locations throughout the estate and left a hidden message for you among the art that hangs in almost every room in this house. This message is the key to unlocking these secrets, but you must be open in your interpretation, as the message itself harbors multiple double meanings and hidden entendres.One final word of advice:\n\nDo not assume the rooms you find today will be the same rooms you find tomorrow. These grounds have provided me a home for the last half century and even I am uncertain of which room lies beyond any particular door.\n\nYour grandmother used to say, \""Don't go where the path leads. Abandon the path and go where you want it to lead.\n\n_ _   _ _\n_ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _,\n_ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ To continue up, you must go down.

However, if our ambitious plans are to succeed, we must strike <u>this</u> Tuesday. The routine changing of guard personnel on the first of each month means the opportunity we have created for ourselves will likely never be so opportune. If we wait even one additional week, the window will be closed.\n\n    On Tuesday, there will be three Royal Guards stationed at Leerson Hall, two of which will be wearing black gloves in lieu of the traditional white. We would be wise to sacrifice almost everything to avoid the white gloved guard, striking only when he takes a recess. The two black gloved guards have been instructed to bind, blind and gag themselves, to spare us the precious extra minutes it would take your group to execute that task on their behalf. However, that also means that once we reach the exhibit, we will truly be on our own.\n\n    May the Black Shores guide us, may the Black Skies shield us, may our fathers be proud of us,\n\n\n                        In arms,\n\n                     your faithful soldier, \n                                \n                           <size=4.8>Farro","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","know:closedExhibitLetter"

Without her, Reddington Elementary would still be a distant and blurry vision. A vision that I dared not even dream. \r\n\r\nThat dreamer is of course, the incomparable Mrs. Peterson, our future principal and my reluctant successor who I might add, forced me to give this speech, so I think I’ll end my praise of her there, though she deserves much more I’ll admit.\r\n\r\nTo the architect of our new school, the Baron Sinclair, thank you for following in your father’s footsteps in building Reddington yet another school. And for also allowing the use of your own private residence and floorplans to serve as our interim facility until the new campus is completed in March.

Unfortunately, even though the dean gave me permission to keep my birds here on campus, I'm afraid it's getting a bit too cold for them as the semester marches on, so I've made the decision to send them all home before the winter months arrive.

It's going to be hard enough now that I am truly on my own. \n     In other news, my classes have been engaging and I am slowly making friends, so please ignore the dramatic despair of my previous letter. Things are indeed looking brighter, but I still maintain that three years is too long a time to be away from home.\n\n - Mary\n\nHerbert,\n     Thank you so much for your gift of the \""wedding doves,\"" whom I, of course, recognized immediately.

Not that I didn't love Mount Holly, of course, but after years of being confined in a tiny dormitory, the small place Daniel and I have picked out in Reddington feels more like a stately manor! Once we've finished unpacking and setting everything up, I'll insist on you making an exception to your reclusive lifestyle to come, share a meal and admire our somwhat less impressive but much more personal view of the town.\n\n Thanks again for the card,\n                               Mary\n\nWe are returning east\nand should arrive on tuesday.\n\nif coast is not clear,\nlower the SD to warn us.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","know:doveLetters"

I had even secured an arrangement with a local firm which was to oversee the mass production of the floorplans. Yet now, after walking the halls of my work, I must confess that I have grown altogether too attached to these rooms. They have become a part of me, and knowing how little regard is often shown for that which I hold sacred, I find myself unequal to the selfless task of sharing them with the world.\n\n\nI am content with this resolution, for this house and the forty-five rooms therein are more than the best work of my career.

Holly but I couldn't risk the contents of these pages falling into unsympathetic hands.\n\nMy personal freezer should prove quite the safebox, as all of the staff have for many years respected my wishes that it remain shut and untampered. (My favorite snacks were also stored here!)\n \nBut in addition to these delicious treats, it has also for the last 20 years stored many a cryptic message and ciphered note. This nondescript cooler is, in fact, a dubious frozen postbox of chilled secrets.\n\nHave you heard of the Children of Black Water?\n\nI have no idea how forthcoming your father has been about the details surrounding your mother's final chapter... or the role he thinks I played in that end. I have always denied involvement. To him. To the detectives. To the crown. And now to you as well.\n\nBut can I honestly say I had nothing to do with her disappearance? And yes, I speak of disappearance, not death. For I, too, cling to the hope that our fears are unfounded, and have occasionally, from time to time, caught fragments of information that bolster this belief.\n\nFragments of information that have cost me plenty, for our country is never short of opportunists and blackmailers.\n\nStill, as I am now dead, I don't want this knowledge to be buried with me, even if that means passing the burden of these fragments onto you. Even if that information may weigh even heavier on your head than the crown involved.\n\nUnfortunately, this information is a little too precious to entrust entirely to this freezer as I'm not too confident that the sanctity of my snacks will extend beyond my life! I've always found it best to use multiple baskets when it comes to incriminating eggs; a lesson that I recently learned again when a member of my staff betrayed my confidence.\n \nI have placed eight red envelopes in eight even more secure locations throughout the estate and left a hidden message for you among the art that hangs in almost every room in this house. This message is the key to unlocking these secrets, but you must be open in your interpretation, as the message itself harbors multiple double meanings and hidden entendres.One final word of advice:\n\nDo not assume the rooms you find today will be the same rooms you find tomorrow. These grounds have provided me a home for the last half century and even I am uncertain of which room lies beyond any particular door.\n\nYour grandmother used to say, \""Don't go where the path leads.

Given the Baron's well-known penchant for tests of mettle and wit, it's clear that the young heir from Reddington, distinguished in his own right as last year's County Science Fair runner-up, faces an extraordinary challenge in the coming weeks.      \n      ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","know:morningPaper"

Otherwise, it has been recycled.\n\nThank you again for thinking of us here at Ruffington, and do not be discouraged to submit any work you complete in the future.
