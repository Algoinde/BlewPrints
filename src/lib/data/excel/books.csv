"theHistoryOfOrindiaAjeraToEraja","The History of Orindia: Ajera to Eraja","","Caleb Manning","","The\nHistory\of Orindia\nAjera to Eraja\nby Caleb Manning\nRuffington Red Publishing\n1979\n\nForeward\n<b><size=3.4>ORINDIA</size></b> was once the name used to designate the realms of the eastern waters. Though the term is no longer employed in the halls of politics, nor commonly known to the average citizen, its memory flickers in the hearts of those who hail from the lands that it once encompassed, and many of the elder generation, in hushed circles, still refer to themselves as Orindians.\n\n\nYet, we must not let the flame of our history dwindle into the obscurity of whispered conversations, nor permit our leaders to enjoin us to abandon the name of our land. We must keep alive the embers of our past and preserve them for the generations yet to come.\n\nI\n<size=4>AJERA</size>Most historians mark the beginning of the first era, often denoted as <i>Ajera</i>, by the ascension of the first king of Orindia whose name, <b>Oris</b>, would later grace the burgeoning township in which he was crowned. Oris was known, before his coronation, as a prominent merchant lord of considerable means and affluence, whose sway in the region made him the ideal candidate for the unification of the surrounding provinces.\r\n\nRegrettably, history is not always forthcoming, and the surviving records of those bygone days are mostly limited to trade agreements and sales receipts. \n\nNevertheless, we can deduce from these ledgers that Oris had but one aim: expansion. The territory spread forth from the heart of Oris and by the end of the first century, the black banners of Orindia could be seen fluttering in every hamlet and hostelry, along every thoroughfare, from Oris, all the way to the western banks. A new kingdom was born.\nCastle Orindia\n\nII\n<size=4>SECOND ERA</size>It was the fourth king of Orindia who split this vast domain in three equal shares. Three Realms for his three children. \n\nTo the eldest, he granted the fields and mountains of his great grandfather, the middle province and heartspring of the kingdom. The eldest accepted the gift and called his new realm <b><size=3>ORINDA ARIES</size></b>, after the angelic paragon of royalty, Orinda. \n\nTo the youngest, he bestowed upon him the realm of <b><size=3>ARCH ARIES</size></b>, the land of the Northern Storms. A wild and untamed \n\nexpanse which at the time was not as developed but a good deal more vast than the eldest brother’s lot.\n\nAnd to his middle child, his only daughter, he gifted her the southern region of <b><size=3>ERAJA</size></b>, the mystical realm of the ancestors, a land steeped in tradition, magic and the poetry of the old tongue.\n\nIII\n<size=4>THIRD ERA</size>As the Second Era drew to a close, the three sovereign realms had achieved a period of remarkable progress and prosperity.  Each of these distinct regions, ruled by their respective sibling monarchs, had blossomed, cultivating the bountiful resources of their lands, and developing a unique character and culture that set them apart from one another.\n\n\nDespite those differences, the sibling monarchs managed to maintain friendly relations throughout their lives, and were known for their cooperation in matters of trade and transportation. The succeeding generations of their heirs continued that tradition and the Third Era was defined by the construction \n\nof a vast network of\nrailways that spanned\nthe length and breadth\nof the land, linking the\nnorthern mountains\nof <b>Arch Aries</b> to\nthe southern shores\nof <b>Eraja</b>. This develop-\nment facilitated travel\nand commerce\nbetween the\nthree realms, further\nstrengthening their bond\nand laying the foundation for the\npromise of a prosperous and bright future, a promise that would unfortunately, as my readers will soon find, not be kept.IV\n<size=4>FOURTH ERA</size>As the kingdom of Orinda Aries entered the fourth era, a different kind of ruler took the reins of power. <b>King Desilets III</b> was a king who listened to the voices of all his subjects, from the most influential advisors to the humblest of citizens. \n\nHe was a king who often was seen among the people, eating, drinking and conversing - a sight that shocked not only the gentry and the court, but the masses as well, who could scarce believe that they, as peasantry, would ever sup with the crown.\r\nDesilets was renowned as “The King of the People” and it was therefore a surprise to no one when he made the decision to move the capital from the secluded mountains of Reddington to the public stage of Oris, leaving castle and court behind. The people were overjoyed by this choice, and the city welcomed their king with open arms and great fanfare. Yet, not all were swayed so easily. There were those that viewed the king’s conduct to be unbecoming of his station, and were wary of how readily he could be persuaded by the tears and tales of the common folk.\r\n\r\nThese dissenting voices planted the seeds of discontent, which took root in the lawns and gardens of the nobles of Fenn, or as I have been instructed to say, the Grand City of Fenn.\n\nV\n<size=4>ERA of RUIN</size>After the passing of King Desilets III, the Fourth Era came to an abrupt end. Thankfully, the king died naturally in his old age and surrounded by his people in Oris, far away from the growing unrest among the western city of Fenn.\n\nOn the very next day, the 6th of October, the self-proclaimed Prince Leerson of Fenn declared himself the true monarch. This declaration was bolstered by a surprising number of supporters, due to the fact that Desilets IV shared his father's good name but little of his virtues.\r\n\r\nAs the prospect of civil war seemed inevitable, the realm’s regiments were hastily recalled from \n\nthe frontiers to stamp out and put an end to the “Fennsurrection”. However, instead of restoring order, what ensued was a savage and merciless campaign against their own people. The gardens of Fenn, once a center of splendor, were transformed into a battlefield as the cries of the innocent echoed through the city's streets, stained in red.\nThe Pacification of Fenn\n\nThe brutality of the pacification of Fenn did not go unnoticed by neighbors. As sympathy for the city surged, allies came forward to lend support. Among them was the general of the Northern Regiment who, sickened by the barbaric actions of the other battalions, joined forces with Prince Leerson to form a formidable army. Together, they leveraged their political influence and favors to persuade the nearby realms of ARCH ARIES and NUANCE to join their cause.\r\n\r\nHowever, even with the tide turning in their favor, victory did not come easy. The <b>War of the Fifth Era</b> lasted 22 long years, and saw buried one in every three men. Prince Leerson himself added another number to the casualties. However, even in death, he had won. Oris had fallen and with it the realm. \r\n\nThe black flags that had flown for five eras were burned, and in their place, red banners were hoisted in honor of the fallen of Fenn. The few remaining members of the former royal family fled in fear of their lives to the south, forever exiled.\n\nVI\n<size=4>THE CURRENT ERA</size>Today, the realms inherited by The Three,  <b>FENN ARIES</b>, <b>ARCH ARIES</b> and <b>ERAJA</b> once again stand united as allies. Though the distance between our peoples has grown, our connection to this land remains as strong as ever. The spruce and birch that span across our realms serve as a constant reminder that we all share a common past. And as those trees continue to grow, so do our hopes for a common future. A future where we are not defined by the colors of the banners we raise, but by that which connects us. A land that we each call home.For this is, despite everything else, a land rich in history, a land of myth and wonder, a land that sprung forth the greatest empire the world has ever seen, the land of our fathers, of our mothers, and of our children. \r\n\r\nThis land is, after all that has happened… \r\n\n\n\n...still Orindia.","19","Author MANNING, CALEB\nTitle THE HISTORY OF ORINDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","book:theHistoryOfOrindiaAjeraToEraja"

"aSightseersGuideToReddington","A Sightseer's Guide to Reddington","","Andrew Darle","","A\nSightseer's\nGuide\nTo Reddington\na modest account of our town by\n<size=3>Sir ANDREW DARLE</size>\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe third-largest city in Fenn Aries, and site of its former capital, <b>Reddington</b> is synonymous with mountains, mystery, and magic. Most tourists head straight for the boardwalk and don’t get much further than the Botanical Gardens. However, Reddington has much more to offer.\n\nSpectacular scenery, a historic castle, and a charming underground bazaar reward visitors who wish to explore further. Reddington is that type of unique, enchanting place that lingers in your mind and memories long after you leave her.\n\nThe Botanical Gardens\nReddington’s most popular attraction and a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, the Botanical Gardens, is loved by both locals and visitors for its Ajeran canopy house and mausoleum, its petal-covered trails, and a mind-boggling variety of flowers. This is the reason springtime is Reddington's busy season.\n\nSituated just east of town, the Botanical Gardens offer a scenic and captivating tableau of the natural countryside. A cobblestone trail meanders past over 1,000 species of tropical plants, each remarkable in its own right, yet even more stunning set against the spectacular backdrop of the Reddington mountains. Allow yourself at least an hour to indulge in this picturesque walk, which concludes at Mainway Station.\nIlex x meserveae\n<size=2>A specimen of Holly unique\nto Reddington’s mountains\n\nFeatherfall Keep\nYou will find sitting at the base of Mt. Perma, Reddington's second highest summit, a historic site described by scholars as significantly important to the realm's past. Featherfall Keep, the former home of Lord William Epsen, has until recently always been a private residence, serving as a family home to the Epsens since before the third era.\n\nAfter the death of Lord Epsen, his oldest son, Lionel Epsen, left the estate never to return; however, the daughter stayed, maintaining the residence and its staff until her marriage in 1951. At that point, Featherfall Keep ceased to be a family residence; it began operating as a historic house museum and tourist attraction, and the estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1972.\n\nIt is still believed by many that Featherfall was built by the first king of Orinda Aries when Reddington was still the capital. However, surfaced documents containing conflicting dates have recently cast some doubt on the long-standing myth.\r\n\nTrinsdale Lake\nClose your eyes and imagine tranquil, serene stillness, rolling fogs, clear water, and gliding swans. In the midst of all that beauty, sits Trinsdale Lake, one of Fenn Aries' premier vacation destinations, exclusive for its more privileged citizens. The lakeside resort and cabins have been frequented by royalty and the realm's gentry for generations. However, on the southern shore of the lake, tourists are free to enjoy the views and rub elbows with the rich and famous in the Hundred Bells Tea Room, which is open to the general public for lunch on Mondays and Fridays.\n\nMount Holly\nAt an elevation of 11,220 feet, Mount Holly is the tallest mountain in the Reddington range <i>and</i> the highest peak in the entire realm. Beyond the physical challenge itself, climbing Mount Holly Trail is a beautiful experience and one that many hikers and explorers will want to do at least once.\n\nIt’s only a few hours from Reddington to get to the trailhead, and you won’t need any local guides or special gear if you tackle the trail during the summer season. However, those willing to give this mountain a significant amount of planning and research will be greatly rewarded, whether or not they actually summit.\r\n\nOn the opposite side of the peak, far from the trail, rests the Estate of Mount Holly, nestled between the summit’s northern slope and saddle. This 80-acre mountain residence is almost as old as Reddington itself, however, unlike Featherfall Keep, the property has been completely private since the closing of the Mount Holly schoolhouse in ‘66. Still, hikers will be able to appreciate the house’s unique architecture at a distance from one of the trail’s many north-facing overlooks.\r\n\nMainway Station Bazaar\nFor the sentimental tourists wishing to pick up a souvenir to remember their stay, one might try braving the Mainway Station Bazaar. But don't be too hasty. Without proper guidance, the Mainway Station can be a dangerous place. Located underground, this unique marketplace was once Reddington's central railway station, in a time when the realm's trains were still in service. Now the turnstiles, footbridge, and platform have been appropriated and turned into a cavern of tents and torches.\n\n\nWhether you are bargain hunting, looking for adventure, or finding a memento to commemorate your visit, the Mainway Station Bazaar will be a worthy conclusion to your sightseeing adventure in Reddington.\n\nAngel Tower\nAries River\nTrinsdale Lake\nMt.

When you are staring at a blank canvas, you have unlimited potential and ideas to explore. But, with an abun-dance of options at your disposal, the architect can also become overwhelmed by the countless choices and decisions that need to be made: <i>Should I draft a Hallway or a Closet? How many bedrooms do I need in my house?  Is Passageway really worth two gems? </i>\nAll these questions can compound, adding layers of complexity and stress to the design process. That's why it's even more important to develop simple and effective strategies that you can employ while drafting your house to ensure a successful project outcome.\n\n   In this volume of ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST, we aim to provide architects with some of those strategies and even assist them in developing their own!\n\nGems, Gems, Gems\nEvery architect needs them.\n\nAlthough many architects employ different strategies when developing their house designs, most of them agree on one guiding principle:\n\n\nHAVE GEMS\nWHILE DRAFTING\n\nOne of the most common ways architects draft them-selves into a corner is by not having the resources they need when opening a new door. If you lack the GEMS to consider all three presented options, you may be forced to draft a room\nyou do not want. To avoid this predicament, focus on drafting rooms that grant you GEMS and prioritize acquiring GEMS as early in the day as you can. This approach is a sure-fire way to set yourself up for success.\n<size=3>READER SUBMITTED</size>\n<color=#A65499>GEM</color> STRATS\n<b>Make sure you check for gems in the room you are in before clicking the door. I do this way too much!</b> \n               - Alice F.\n<b>Think about saving some gems for emer-gencies. I try to only spend them if I really, really need a room!</b> \n                 -Jenn H.\n<b>I will never draft PASSAGEWAY on the first five ranks. It's a simple strat that has served me well. </b> \n                 -Kyle P.\n<b>If you see GEMS for sale in any of the shops. Buy them out! </b> \n            -Matthew M.\n<b>Don't pass up WINE CELLAR, even if you're not thirsty. There's no such thing as too many GEMS!  <size=1.7>(I may have a bit of a problem...)</b></size>\n                -Craig O.\n\nPlanning Your House\nEstate Layout and Drafting\nWhen you begin drafting a house, it's important to start each day with a solid foundation:\n\n\nDRAFT EARLY\nRANKS FIRST\n\nA very common mistake beginners make is drafting in a straight line north, and ignoring the many unopened doors they have left behind in the Entrance Hall and rooms of the early ranks. When these architects reach the higher ranks, they quickly  discover  they  do\nnot have enough keys or gems to continue. Their day usually ends by returning to the lower ranks to draft from the doors they skipped, only to find rooms and items that would have made all the difference if they had only been found earlier in the day.\nAs the layout to the right demonstrates, even a path of rooms that snakes through the house and does not go in a straight line can also be structurally weak if you are leaving lots of unopened doors on the ranks behind you.\n\nBy starting each day on a strong foundation of rooms on the early ranks, you will have a much better chance of finding success when you eventually start heading further into the house.\n\nTop Drafting Combos\nFive Combos You Won't Want to Miss!\nAnother aspect to consider when planning your house is the order in which you draft rooms. For instance, if you draft CLOISTER before TERRACE, you will be down 3 gems. But, if you draft them in the reverse order, CLOISTER would\nbe free! Identifying a synergistic pair of floorplans is an essential first step. But, determining the opti-mal order for drafting those rooms will provide you with an additional advantage, significantly improving your chances of success.\n\n<size=6>OTHER</size>\nFLOORPLAN COMBOS\nA <b>FOYER</b> drafted before <b>GREAT HALL</b> would mean that all of its many doors would be unlocked.\nDrafting <b>BUNK ROOM</b> after <b>NURSERY</b> will give you 10 extra steps because it counts as two separate bedroom triggers.\nYou won't have to backtrack constantly to collect your gold spread from <b>OFFICE</b>,  if you draft a <b><size=1.8>CONFERENCE ROOM</b>.\nThe more items you have, the greater your chances of being able to create a contraption in  WORKSHOP.\nMaking a Connection\nEstate Connectivity\nTwo-pair combos aren't the only form of room synergy. You will find some floorplans <i>only</i> work by drafting other specific rooms! These rooms aren't powerful on their own, but can become very useful\nwhen their connectivity is eventually discovered. The <b>UTILITY CLOSET</b> is a perfect example of this! It does't do anything by itself but it can literally power up (or down) other rooms you have drafted in your house.\n<b>• GARAGE</b> - <i> powers garage door and\n grants west path access</i>\n<b>• DARKROOM- <i> turns lights back on after blowing a fuse</i>\n<b>• GYMNASIUM</b> - <i> turns lights off to prevent step loss</i>\n\nOTHER EXAMPLES\n<size=3><i>of connectivity</size>\nOne of the more simple examples, <b>HER LADYSHIP'S CHAMBER</b> has synergy with Lady Epsen's other two rooms, her <b>BOUDOIR</b> and her <b>WALK-IN CLOSET</b>.\nThe <b>BOILER ROOM</b> connects ducts from room to room to run steam-power to specific destinations in the house. <b>LABORATORY, GARAGE,   LAUNDRY ROOM, FURNACE</b> and <b>PUMP ROOM</b> all have uses for steam-power.\nSpeaking of <b>PUMP ROOM</b>, this room controls the water level throughout rooms in the estate and can interact directly with <b>THE POOL, AQUARIUM, GREENHOUSE</b>, <b>KITCHEN</b>, and several other features located outside of the main house.\n\nTIPS & TRICKS\n•   In the KITCHEN, you can check which course is being\n    served in the DINING ROOM that day. This will allow\n    you the opportunity to draft specific rooms that will\n    make the meal even more delicious!\n\n•  Besides counting as two bedrooms, BUNK ROOM also \n   counts as two rooms! This will increase the amount of \n   steps granted by MASTER BEDROOM, the amount    \n   of gold spread by the TOMB and the amount of keys\n   found in a SERVANT'S QUARTERS.\n   \n•  Each time you solve a puzzle in BILLIARD ROOM \n   or PARLOR, the difficulty will increase slightly the\n   next time you draft that room.\n\n•  Just because you didn't find any items in a room when\n   you first explored it, doesn't mean that will be the case\n   the next time you draft it.\n•  The day after drafting FREEZER, it enters an automated cooldown refreezing cycle, during which it cannot be drafted for the next 24 hours.\n\n•  If you are stuck or don't know what to do in a specific\n   room, sometimes it is smart to move on. There are multiple \n   ways to solve many of the challenges you will come across,\n   and there is a very good chance you will find a piece of\n   information down the road which may help.\n\n•  When in doubt:\n\nDRAFT ROOMS YOU HAVE\nNEVER SEEN BEFORE\n\n   Even if you do not think the rooms seem very useful,\n   they may still hold useful clues and information that may\n   help you on your journey.\n\nWORD FROM THE EDITOR\nAlthough with this volume we have provided our readers\nwith many potential strategies and tricks to try, we here at ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST hope that aspiring architects know that there truly is no set blueprint for success. \n\nForging your own path and coming up with your own unique strategies will, in our humble opinion, always provide the best results. Each architect has his own favorite room, each builder his own favorite tool. And thus, each player in turn will develop their own style of play and discover their own secrets and tricks that they can share with the world (or keep to themselves).\n\nWhatever strategy you employ, we wish you best of luck drafting and hope you build the house of your dreams.","","PERIODICAL\nTitle - Drafting Strategy Vol III\nDate Borrower\nJun 5 '93 Kimberly Thompson","""Features"" in the table of contents is currently typo'd as ""feautres""","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","book:draftingStrategyVolIii"
